To run the project -> 1- connect to mssql and Create a database called search_engine in mssql
                      2- run the file called CrawlerMain.java to start crawling,indexing and ranking websites
		      3- In the case that you stop the program before crawler finishes crawling its limit
			 of pages you should run the Ranker.java module on its own to rank pages crawled so far
		         as the popularity ranking starts after the crawler finishes to get more accurate results 
                      4- to run the website 
				1. run tomcat
				2. run the main.jsp file on tomcat 
Dependencies ->  jsoup.jar
